# x64 Assembly Sandbox

### I have used [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) to assemble each and every assembly file here

###  Some useful resources/databases i have used while making these:
- [Intel Intrinsics guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#) useful for comparing with compiler intrinsic assembly
- [Understanding x64 Assembly on Windows](https://sonictk.github.io/asm_tutorial/#introduction/requirements) excellent starter by [sonictk](https://github.com/sonictk)
- [x86 and AMD64 Instruction database](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/) by felix cloutier

### Tools used
- Visual Studio 2022 (most of the assembly here was packed into dlls using its linker and exported for testing)
- [x64Dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) when visual studio's debugger wasnt enough for me

Now go beat the compiler because it refuses to use all registers
